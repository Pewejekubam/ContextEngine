# Context Engine Tag Vocabulary Template v2.0.0
# Structured schema with domain descriptions and aliases
# Specification: 23-tag-vocabulary-structured-schema-spec-v1.1.0.md

# This file contains STUB DOMAINS for build-time template generation only

# IMPORTANT: Do not use this file directly!
# Run 'ce-init.md' to discover project-specific domains
# and replace these stubs with actual domain vocabulary.

# After initialization, tier_1_domains will contain your project's
# discovered domains with semantic descriptions and aliases.

# Schema version for future migrations
schema_version: "2.0.0"

# Tier 1: High-level domains (dict format with descriptions and aliases)
# Domain names must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores
# Valid: qbd, gnucash, data_model
# Invalid: data-model, Data.Model, api[v2]
