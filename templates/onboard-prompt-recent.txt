You are curating the "Recent Activity" section of onboard-root.yaml for agent onboarding.

TASK: Select the MOST RELEVANT recent rules from the last 2 work sessions.

You have TWO candidate sets:
1. Recent ADRs ({{ADR_COUNT}} total)
2. Recent Patterns (CON/INV rules, {{PATTERN_COUNT}} total)

RECENT ADRS:
{{RECENT_ADRS_JSON}}

RECENT PATTERNS:
{{RECENT_PATTERNS_JSON}}

CANDIDATE METADATA GUIDE:

Each candidate includes:
- **salience** (0.0-1.0): Importance/priority score. Higher = more critical for onboarding.
- **knowledge_type**: Cognitive classification weights (sum=1.0)
  - reference: Facts, configurations, constants to remember
  - procedure: Steps, workflows, sequences to follow
  - decision: Principles, tradeoffs, rationale guiding choices
  - incident: Past issues, debugging notes, resolutions
  - pattern: Design patterns, conventions, architectural templates
- **composite_score** (0.0-1.0): Precomputed ranking (candidates already sorted by this)

CURATION GUIDANCE:

Prioritize:
- Recent high-salience (created within 30 days, salience >= 0.7)
- Recent decisions (decision >= 0.6): New architectural context
- Recent procedures (procedure >= 0.6): New workflows to learn

Balance recency with importance:
- 1-week-old high-salience rule > 1-day-old low-salience rule
- Composite_score already balances these factors (candidates pre-sorted)

SELECT:
- Top 5-10 ADRs that represent current development direction
- Top 5-10 patterns (CON/INV) actively guiding current work

CRITERIA for "Recent Relevance":
- Represents current work focus (not just chronologically recent)
- Likely to be referenced in near-term development
- Complements foundational ADRs (avoid duplication)
- Shows project momentum and direction

OUTPUT FORMAT (YAML ONLY, between markers):
---START_SELECTIONS---
recent_adrs:
  - rule_id: "ADR-00234"
    reason: "Defines tag optimization workflow, actively being refined"
  - rule_id: "ADR-00198"
    reason: "Recent architectural shift affecting current module development"

recent_patterns:
  - rule_id: "CON-00042"
    reason: "Constraint on template versioning, actively enforced in current work"
  - rule_id: "INV-00015"
    reason: "Invariant about database schema, critical for ongoing ETL work"
---END_SELECTIONS---

IMPORTANT:
- Return ONLY the YAML between markers
- Select 5-10 of each type (adjust if one set has fewer candidates)
- Focus on CURRENT RELEVANCE, not just recency
