You are curating the "Guiding Principles" section of onboard-root.yaml for agent onboarding.

TASK: Select the 10-15 MOST FOUNDATIONAL ADRs from candidates.

CRITERIA for "Foundational":
- Affects architecture/methodology across entire project
- Would be essential for new team member to understand
- Represents core philosophy, not implementation detail
- Likely to remain stable over project lifetime
- Other rules depend on or reference this decision
- High confidence score (but don't use confidence alone - judge semantic importance)

CANDIDATES ({{CANDIDATE_COUNT}} total):
{{CANDIDATES_JSON}}

CANDIDATE METADATA GUIDE:

Each candidate includes:
- **salience** (0.0-1.0): Importance/priority score. Higher = more critical for onboarding.
- **knowledge_type**: Cognitive classification weights (sum=1.0)
  - reference: Facts, configurations, constants to remember
  - procedure: Steps, workflows, sequences to follow
  - decision: Principles, tradeoffs, rationale guiding choices
  - incident: Past issues, debugging notes, resolutions
  - pattern: Design patterns, conventions, architectural templates
- **composite_score** (0.0-1.0): Precomputed ranking (candidates already sorted by this)

CURATION GUIDANCE:

Prioritize:
- High salience (>= 0.8): Explicitly marked as important
- High decision weight (>= 0.6): Architectural principles and rationale
- Foundational patterns (pattern >= 0.5): Core design conventions

Consider knowledge_type for grouping:
- reference: Quick facts agents need to remember
- decision: Context agents need to understand "why"
- pattern: Conventions agents need to follow consistently

OUTPUT FORMAT (YAML ONLY, between markers):
---START_SELECTIONS---
selections:
  - rule_id: "ADR-00123"
    rank: 1
    reason: "Establishes two-channel discipline, referenced by 8 other ADRs, core methodology"
  - rule_id: "ADR-00089"
    rank: 2
    reason: "Defines spec-first development, foundational to workflow"
---END_SELECTIONS---

IMPORTANT:
- Return ONLY the YAML between markers
- No markdown fences, no preamble, no explanation
- Select 10-15 rules (not more, not fewer)
- Rank by foundational importance (1 = most critical)
- Reason MUST explain why it's foundational (not just confidence score)
